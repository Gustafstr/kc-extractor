## **HR Interview in pairs (40% of the final grade)**

**Objective:** conducting an interview in pairs (formed in session 3 – UB) with a manager, an HR or any other person in an organization related to HR issues on one of the topics discussed in class (gender equality, recruiting without discrimination, managing motivation, etc.). This interview can be conducted face-to-face, by video conference or by telephone. The interview must be prepared in advance by creating an interview guide with 6-7 questions. You can film or record the interviewee after asking for his/her permission. Otherwise, take as many notes as possible during the interview to have verbatim notes to use.

**The two most significant/relevant videos by UB will be shown in session 9.** Therefore, if you include video fragments of your interview in your final video, the interviewee will have to sign an image rights form.

- **Type of final production:** video (MP4, AVI format) of 4 minutes
- **Method of delivery:** deposit of the video on *Flip* [\(https://info.flip.com/\)](https://info.flip.com/) via the "Join Code" provided by your teacher
- **Due date:** 7 days before session 9 in UB (-2 points from 1 to 24 hours late, then 0/20 after 24 hours late)
- **Please note:** 
  - You must mention the first name, surname, position and company of the interviewee. Try as much as possible to include elements that attest to the veracity of your interview. In case of doubt, each teacher reserves the right to contact the interviewee on LinkedIn to ask if the interview took place. In the event that a team falsified his interview, team members will be given a grade of 0/20 and will be referred to the disciplinary board.
  - Both members of the pair must appear on screen and/or speak during the video.

## **Content of the video**

The 4-minute video should not be a patchwork, a "best of" of the best moments of the interview or the entire interview filmed.

You should convey the key issues of your interview by speaking on camera, by putting yourself in the scene, by using software such as VideoScribe, etc. If you use passages from the interview, they should be very limited (1 or 2 passages of max 15 seconds to illustrate a point).

Here is an example: you have chosen to interview Rachel Astolfi, a HR Director at Sanofi in Montpellier, in pairs, on the subject of recruitment. You present Rachel, her background and her job in 40 seconds in the video and then structure your video into 2-3 main parts based on her answers.
