#### FORCED RANKING

![](0__page_10_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### The illicit nature of forced ranking

On March 27, 2013, the French Court of Cassation affirmed its illegality. Hewlett-Packard France imposed a classification of employees into 5 performance groups, according to proportions fixed in advance: the weakest group had to include at least 5% of employees, the most successful group at most 20%. For the judges, the existence of imperative quotas is not admissible, as it may lead the assessor to classify in the worst group employees who would have deserved a better assessment if only the analysis of their work had been taken into account

The performance review of employees must be based on objective/relevant methods and criteria.

#### TOWARDS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANNUAL REVIEWS?

#### Are annual interviews obsolete and counterproductive?

"In fact, annual reviews have often become useless, even counter-productive: a Globoforce study indicates that more than **half of employees** are demotivated by annual reviews, while Tower Watson analyzed that 43% of the best performing employees received feedback once a week which, according to Gallup, would increase productivity by 12.5%!"

## THE LIMITS OF THE ANNUAL INTERVIEW

- The **annual interview** is nowadays more and  $\sim$ more criticized because it is no longer adapted to the needs and rhythm of organizations:
- Employees want **more recognition and visibility** on their career progression.
- The annual interview, based on a culture of results, is often a source of frustration and stress because the review is frequently linked to issues of rating, compensation and/or promotion.
- The annual interview, associated with a hierarchical relationship, can be unsuitable for the structure of the company and its coordination mode.
- The **annual frequency** of the interview is no longer adapted to the reality of organizations.
- The annual interview doesn't take sufficient account of teamwork

## THE BIASES OF THE ANNUAL INTERVIEW

- Managers' personalities and the quality of their relationships with employees tend to affect their judgments:
- The most "pleasant" managers give higher  $\bullet$ ratings.
- Good relationships lead to better ratings.  $\bullet$
- Managers' stereotypes about the demographics of their subordinates (age, ethnicity, gender...) also impact their evaluations!

# THE REVIEW METHOD FOR LIBERATED COMPANIES

## **Liberated company: definition**

- Some organizations, such as FAVI, have eliminated the annual interview in favor of **more** frequent feedback.
- Others have implemented **peer review**. The major benefit is to give each person a broader and more meaningful perspective of their contribution to the life of the organization.
- The feedback system goes beyond the context of the work itself and its results. It leads to a broader exploration of people's expectations, fears and sense of commitment to the company.
