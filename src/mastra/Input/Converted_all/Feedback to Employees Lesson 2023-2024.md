### PROVIDING POSITIVE FEEDBACK

 According to a study conducted by Marcial Losada (Chilean psychologist) and Emily Heaphy (American academic) in 2004, on average, an employee ideally needs 6 positive feedbacks for each negative feedback received.

## **HOW TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK?**

- **Stay calm.** Control your emotions.
- Practice active listening.
- Focus on the **employee's behaviors**  $\sim$ and not on the person.
- Give **concrete examples.**
- For example:
- "Jade, you are not motivated!" NO  $\bullet$
- "Jade, you turned in your last reports late. In  $\bullet$ addition, you didn't participate in the discussions at the October 15 meeting. How do you explain this?" YFS
- Open up to **action**.

- It comes from a **credible source**.
- It is supported by **objective and accurate data**.  $\sim$
