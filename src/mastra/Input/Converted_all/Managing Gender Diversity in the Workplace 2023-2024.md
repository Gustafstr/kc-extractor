### THE ISSUE OF INTERSECTIONALITY (CRENSHAW, 1989)

Definition  $\blacksquare$ 

### A sort of multiple discrimination

For example, the experience of being from an ethnic minority background and also a woman is not just the sum of the two disadvantages (ethnicity and sex) but rather the product of the interaction between these two characteristics

The interaction represents a **greater** disadvantage that is distinct from a specific category and reinforce social inequalities.

# REMINDER OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN FRANCE

**Equal treatment of women and men** in the workplace requires the employer to respect several principles:

- 1. **Prohibition of discrimination** during the recruitment process.
- 2. Lack of differentiation in compensation and career progression.
- 3. Obligations towards employee representatives (provision of information on professional equality in the economic and social database, negotiations).
- 4. Information to employees and candidates for employment and implementation of measures to prevent sexual harassment in the company.

> Civil/criminal remedies and sanctions are provided for in the event of non-compliance with gender equality.
