## II. Introduction and process steps

![](_page_4_Picture_1.jpeg)

### BEST PRACTICES IN THE DEFINITION OF A JOB PROFILE

- 1. Develop the job definition **collectively**: compare one's vision of the job, look for job descriptions in other teams or companies...
- 2. Don't stick too closely to the representation you have of people who are currently (or have been) in office.
- 3. Put forward specific missions in a **simple and effective language** that speaks to everyone.
- 4. Open up the criteria to avoid the masculinization or feminization of missions and professions.

The Late Show host, Stephen Colbert, put himself in the shoes of a recruiter by interviewing the President of the United States. Indeed, Obama will soon lose his job.

At 55 years old and without any promotion for 8 years, it's not easy to defend his resume

# IV. The persistent challenges of recruitment

![](1__page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)

# CANDIDATE OR RECRUITER: KNOWING THE BIASES

**Cognitive bias: definition** 

## **Conformity or social desirability bias** $\sim$

The candidate may be tempted to modify his or her answers according to the  $\bullet$ recruiter's assumed expectations.

## **Primacy effect** $\sim$

 The information received first would determine one's impression of others more than the information received later

### **Halo effect**

‚Ä¢ Since the recruiter is unable to independently evaluate each trait of the candidate, he or she forms an overall opinion based on the evaluation of a single criteria (Laberon, 2011).

## LIMITING DISCRIMINATION

French Law N¬∞2008-496 of May 27, 2008 amended by Law N¬∞2016-1547 of November 18, 2016 - art. 86 defines discrimination as follows:

"Direct discrimination is any situation in which, on the basis of origin, sex, family status, pregnancy, physical appearance, particular vulnerability resulting from the economic situation, apparent or known to the perpetrator, surname, place of residence, state of health, loss of autonomy, disability, genetic characteristics, morals, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, political opinions, union activities, ability to express oneself in a language other than French, membership or non-membership, real or assumed, of a specific ethnic group, nation, alleged race or religion, a person is treated less favorably than another is, has been or will be treated in a comparable situation."

## LIMITING DISCRIMINATION

- Tools:  $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Testing
- Blind CV
- Recruitments without a CV
- -The disappointed hopes of the video resume
- Training courses
- Personal branding

## THE ISSUES OF DISMISSAL

![](2__page_33_Picture_2.jpeg)

![](2__page_33_Picture_3.jpeg)

![](2__page_33_Picture_5.jpeg)

## THE ISSUES OF DISMISSAL

- Dismissal is a termination of the employment contract at the initiative of the employer, unlike resignation (at the initiative of the employee) and conventional termination (which requires the agreement of both parties).
- In France, an employee cannot be dismissed randomly or arbitrarily. Any dismissal must be motivated by a **real** and **serious reason**.
- The reason for the dismissal must be both **real**, i.e. the facts must be exact and verifiable, but also **serious**: the facts must be serious enough for the dismissal to be unavoidable
- 2 main types of dismissals: dismissal for personal reasons and economic dismissal.
