# THE EFFICIENCY WAGE THEORY

- When hiring an employee, there is an asymmetry of information. The  $\sim$ employer doesn't know whether the employee will be highly productive or unproductive (a "talent" or not).
- The only way to attract and retain the most productive is to provide a salary above the market price. This also leads the less productive internally to increase their contributions (for fear of being laid off and not finding an equivalent salary).

- A ratio that is judged to be unbalanced (in one direction or another) calls  $\sim$ for a **rebalancing**.
- For example: increase or reduce one's contribution...

# VI. Recognition at work: a current issue

![](2__page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### SOME FIGURES ON RECOGNITION

- According to Hay Group's "Preparing for take-off" survey, in France,  $\Box$ average turnover was estimated at **15.1%** in 2018. One of the primary causes is lack of recognition.
- According to the 2018 Odoxa-Dentsu Aegis Network barometer, French employees are satisfied with their work (72%), their relationships with colleagues (88%) and their superiors (72%). Nevertheless, while nearly 80% of employees believe they are doing "useful" work, only 50% feel their work is recognized for its true value, and only 11% feel they receive the positive feedback and recognition they deserve "when they do a good job."
