### CASE STUDY (IN PAIRS/20 MINUTES OF THOUGHT)

- Objective: to identify the current issues of gender equality in the workplace and to propose courses of action for companies.
- Question 1: what are your **own stereotypes** about gender in professional life, i.e. with regard to women and men? Identify those that you have as a "woman" with respect to women and men/those that you have as a "man" with respect to women and men.
- Question 2: how do you explain the **persistent inequalities** between women and men in professional life?
- Question 3: beyond the respect of the laws in force, propose **two concrete**  $\blacksquare$ actions to be taken in the company to try to remedy the inequalities of treatment between women and men. Support your proposals with concrete elements.

#### TO START: SOME FIGURES

- 4% of drivers, construction workers and mechanics are women.
- 18% of engineers and computer scientists are women.
- Women outnumber men in food service, cleaning, health care, clerical and  $\sim$ cashier jobs.
- 4% of CEOs of publicly traded companies are women, and women make up only 22% of supervisory board members.

#### THE VARIOUS STEREOTYPES

Hetero-stereotype: stereotype about a group to which one does not belong.

Ex: I think that computer scientists are useless. Homosexual employees are more tolerant.

**Self-stereotype:** stereotype about a group to which one belongs.

 $Ex$ : the sales force is the most important position in our company. In my team, those who have the same degree as me are the most successful.

**Meta-stereotype:** an assumed stereotype that someone would have about themselves.

 $Ex$ : women don't have a chance in this company, I don't apply. I've been in such and such a position: I'm sure X will promote me for that, it happens all the time.

#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: THE CASE OF THE GLASS CEILING

#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: THE CASE OF THE GLASS CEILING

- How can we explain the glass ceiling?  $\mathbb{R}$
- The persistence of gender stereotypes but also of "self-censorship" on the part of women
- A preference for similarity (homophily):  $\bullet$ "masculine" organizations (norms, codes)
- More limited women's networks  $\bullet$
- The "family-work" conflict  $\bullet$
- A different vision of career and power  $\bullet$
- Sexist attitudes in the workplace (lack of an  $\bullet$ inclusive climate)

#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: SUMMARY

- On the demand side
- Women are less likely to offer their services for leadership positions because:
  - a lack of identification and self-censorship (**queen bee syndrome**)
  - a lesser proactivity (the Cinderella complex)
  - the desire for a balance of life times (the Cinderella complex)
    - ‚Üí The Curie myth
    - ‚Üí "Gender fatigue"

# CONCRETE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES
