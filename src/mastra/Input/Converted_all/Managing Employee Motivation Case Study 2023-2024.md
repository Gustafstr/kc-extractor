What are the stakes of this decision for Amazon? (benefits/risks for the company/interest for Amazon of such a decision)

Your proposals should be based on theories and concepts seen in class

#### **Advantages for Amazon**

- Having a majority of employees who are punctual (obtaining a desired behavior thanks to a financial incentive)  $\rightarrow$  **extrinsic motivation**
- **Equity theory (Adams, 1965):** the company rewards those who are on time compared to those who are late. Employees who are on time make a greater contribution than those who are late, and therefore deserve better remuneration
- This decision can improve Amazon's **employer brand**  $\rightarrow$  attracting and retaining talent
- This decision aims to **encourage Organizational Citizenship Behaviors** (OCB) (Organ, 1988).

What are the stakes of this decision for Amazon? (benefits/risks for the company/interest for Amazon of such a decision)

Your proposals should be based on theories and concepts seen in class

#### Risks for Amazon

- Risk to Amazon's financial equilibrium (the bonus is high, weekly and paid to all permanent employees).
- **Equity theory (Adams, 1965):** this bonus is only paid to permanent employees in the UK. Inequity with non-permanent employees (temporary workers, etc.) who are nonetheless punctual and those who work outside the UK  $\rightarrow$  source of tension/revolt
- Extrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985): this bonus focuses solely on punctuality. It does not mean that employees will be more intrinsically motivated by their work and therefore perform better.

What are the stakes of this decision for Amazon? (benefits/risks for the company/interest for Amazon of such a decision)

Your proposals should be based on theories and concepts seen in class

#### Risks for Amazon

- Punctuality is a basic business principle. If Amazon decides to reward such  $\sim$ a basic attitude, employees may be tempted to ask for bonuses for **other basic behaviors** (saying hello, respecting equipment, etc.)  $\rightarrow$  a vicious circle could emerge
- **Overjustification effect:** if the company abolishes the bonus, there is a risk that the number of people who are late will increase.
