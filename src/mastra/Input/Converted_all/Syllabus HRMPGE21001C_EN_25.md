As stipulated in the MBS teaching method:

Before each session, the learner must familiarize himself/herself with the materials that will be useful for the course. He/she must also complete the required personal work within the allotted time.

During lectures, students are expected to take an active part in discussions of theoretical concepts and examples, giving their opinions in a well-argued manner.

An active contribution from students can enrich the teaching process, providing additional information to the topics presented in class. During class, students can question the teacher on the topics presented.

During face-to-face classes (promo and UB), the use of computers is not allowed unless authorized by the teacher. Students are encouraged to take notes in writing, to encourage concentration and learning.

A special forum on the e-learning platform can be used by students to ask questions and, if necessary, clarify concepts studied in class.
