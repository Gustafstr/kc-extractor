## CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT

- Conduct an interview in pairs with a manager, an HR or any person from an organization related to HR issues on one of the themes discussed in class (gender equality, recruiting without discrimination, managing motivation, etc.).
- This interview can be conducted face-to-face, by video conference or by telephone.
- It must be prepared in advance by creating **an interview guide** consisting of 6-7 questions.
- This work will be presented in the form of a four-minute video. The format is free, but the video must be structured in such a way as to highlight the most important points of the interview (a brief presentation of the interviewee, no more than 40 seconds long).

## CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT

- Please note: the 4-minute video should not be a patchwork or a "best of" of the best moments of the interview.
- You have to convey the main issues of your interview by speaking on by putting yourself on stage, by using software... camera. If you use passages from the interview, they should be very limited (1 or 2 passages of max 15 seconds to illustrate a point).

"Human resources" 

Human resources management is the set of practices implemented to manage, mobilize and develop the human resources involved in the activity of an organization.

These "human resources" are all the employees of all statuses (workers, employees, managers) belonging to the organization.

## $\rightarrow$ Is it an oxymoron?

# VI. Managing employer brand

![](1__page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)
### EMPLOYER BRAND

"The set of functional, economic and psychological benefits inherent to a job and with which the company, as the employer, is identified."

(Ambler & Barrow, 1996, p. 187)

- A process: efforts made to create and communicate the message that this company is an "employer of choice", different from its competitors.
  - 1. Identification of employee benefits
  - 2. Communication
  - 3. Whether or not the promise is kept

![](2__page_27_Picture_7.jpeg)

![](2__page_27_Picture_9.jpeg)

# THE TWO SIDES OF THE EMPLOYER BRAND

# FOR

- Promote the company  $\sim$
- Differences and desirability from others
- Service offering  $\sim$

### AGAINST

- Storytelling  $\sim$
- Discrepancies between  $\sim$ promises and reality
