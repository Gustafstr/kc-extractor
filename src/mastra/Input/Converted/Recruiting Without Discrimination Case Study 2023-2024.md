- A company has conducted a review of its workforce and skills management. Within the HR department, the company is not able to ensure the succession for the positions of HR managers on the production sites spread throughout France.
- Its population is aging and the managers in place are not mobile. For them, HRM positions on a site don't represent a development either in terms of level of responsibility or in terms of compensation.
- The solution adopted by the company would be to recruit young candidates with initial experience from outside the company and to train them by placing them in assistant positions or with partial responsibilities (such as training, recruitment, skills management or social relations). In this way, the company would create a pool of talent

- Isn't it risky to position very young candidates in positions where experience  $\bullet$ is an asset, especially in a human resources manager position that requires skills in social negotiation?
- Is it possible to consider trajectories other than upward mobility? For example, after 50 years of age, a candidate could return to a position with a lower level of responsibility and desired compensation.

- Is it not possible to entrust, in addition to operational responsibilities,  $\bullet$ transversal projects to a senior employee in order to better exploit his or her skills (for example, training and mentoring of young recruits)?
- The company is faced with fewer candidates and very high salary expectations for these profiles aged between 30 and 35 years old, as all the major groups are targeting this type of profile. Wouldn't it be better to change its target?
