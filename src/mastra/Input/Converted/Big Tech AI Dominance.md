### 5 years GDPR: 4th edition of the CMS Enforcement Tracker Report now available

The 2023 anniversary edition of the CMS Enforcement Tracker Report is now available providing a deep dive into fines imposed under the GDPR: link

![](1__page_16_Picture_12.jpeg)

## GDPR Enforcement Tracker

The CMS.Law GDPR Enforcement Tracker is an overview of fines and penalties which data protection authorities within the EU have imposed under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, DSGVO). Our aim is to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Since not all fines are made public, this list can of course never be complete, which is why we appreciate any indication of further GDPR fines and penalties. Please note that we do not list any fines imposed under national / non-European laws, under non-data protection laws (e.g. competition laws / electronic communication laws) and under "old" pre-GDPR-laws. We have, however, included a limited number of essential ePrivacy fines under national member state laws.

### New features: "ETid" and "Direct URL"!

We have assigned a unique and permanent ID to each fine in our database, which makes it possible to precisely address fines, e.g. in publications. Once an "ETid" has been assigned to a fine, it remains the same, even if the fine is overturned or amended by courts at a later date, or if we add fines that were issued chronologically before. The "Direct URL" (click "+" or on a specific ETid to view details of a fine) can be used to share fines online, e.g. on Twitter or other media.
