# Business Applications in Artificial Intelligence

Taylor, E. (2024)

#### **Decision & Game Theory:**

The course "Decision and Game Theory" aims to familiarise students with a formal decision-making theory under risk and uncertainty and in strategic setups. Students will learn how to model risky and uncertain alternatives.

#### **Business Applications in Al:**

Al is transforming the way we do business. In 2020 alone, investment in AI companies quadrupled to \$40 billion worldwide against the \$10 billion invested in 2015. Advertising, healthcare, insurance, HR, and education - AI and big data radically transform how we do business. Or does it? In this class, we will explore the promises of AI, its potential, the craze it generated, and the truth about how it is (or is not) transforming businesses. We will also dive into Al's potential and discuss its impact in future years. We will also discuss the ethical implications of Al. One of the promises of Al is to achieve goals faster and more reliable. But what about fairness, accuracy, and precision? We will explore the concept of algorithmic biases and discuss how to minimise the negative impacts of AI to harness the best of its power. The class will be based on interviews from leaders in the field and concrete cases from the video game industry, fashion, education, music, fraud detection, and HR.

#### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:

This course presents the strategic value of artificial intelligence (AI) on digital content's supply and demand sides. It includes an illustration of how Albased tools enable viral content production and personalised consumption and delivery. The course compares the approaches of companies, research organisations, and different countries to Al, generating important distinctions in terms of implementation and innovation. Other concepts are discussed, such as the internationalisation of digital platforms, the control of illegal content on the web and the possibility of filtering content through AI and human intervention.

#### **Big Data and IT systems governance**

Big Data & IT Systems Governance encompasses a set of practices, processes, and policies to ensure that an organisation's IT systems effectively support its strategic goals, are secure, compliant with regulations, and operate efficiently. The course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills to manage, oversee, and optimise an organisation's IT infrastructure and systems. It explores the intersection of technology, business strategy, Big Data use and compliance to ensure that IT resources are aligned with organisational objectives.

# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

What is (Artificial) Intelligence?

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

Useful definition by properties that are characteristic to (A)I

## ▪ Reasoning

The ability to choose the most appropriate algorithm, among a set of algorithms, to use in a particular context and solve a problem

## ▪ Autonomy

The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user

▪ Adaptivity

The ability to improve performance by learning from experience (self-correction aspect)

It has been long understood that **learning** is a key element of intelligence. This holds both for natural intelligence – we all get smarter by learning – and artificial intelligence

## Related fields to AI

### Computer science

Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.

### Data science

Is a recent umbrella term that includes machine learning, deep learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development.

### Robotics

It means building and programming robots so that they can operate in complex, real-world scenarios. In a way, robotics is the ultimate challenge of Al since it requires a combination of virtually all areas of Al.

# Solving problems with Artificial Intelligence

- Turing, father of computer programming (1950): *"If a computer is indistinguishable from a human in a general natural language conversation, then it must have reached human-level intelligence."*
- McCarthy, father of AI *(1955)*: *"Intelligence is intelligence even if the system that implements it is just a computer that mechanically follows a program."*
- Searle (1980): *"Even if a machine behaves in an intelligent manner, for example, by passing the Turing test, it doesn't follow that it is intelligent or that it has a "mind" (conscious) in the way that a human has."*
- **McCarthy** *(1997)***:** *"Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals"* → **Narrow and Weak AI**

# What matters in practice? Key terminology

### ▪ **General vs Narrow AI**

Narrow AI refers to AI that handles one task. General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can handle any intellectual task. All the AI methods we use today +-fall under narrow AI, with general AI being in the realm of science fiction.

#### ▪ **Strong vs Weak AI**

A related dichotomy is "strong" and "weak" AI. This boils down to the above philosophical distinction between being intelligent (Turing) and acting intelligently (Searle). Strong AI would amount to a "mind" that is genuinely intelligent and selfconscious. Weak AI is what we actually have, namely systems that exhibit intelligent behaviors despite being "mere" computers.

## Expert Systems

![](0__page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

Expert system is a part of AI and a computer program that is used to solve complex problems, and to give the decision-making ability like humans with the help of **a knowledge base, an inference engine (forward/backward chaining), and a user interface.**

## Expert Systems

![](0__page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)

- An problem-solving agent perceives and acts upon the environment using **sensors and actuators**. With sensors, it senses the surrounding, and with actuators, it acts on it.
- An intelligent agent improves its performance with **learning algorithms**.

The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like.

Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself.

What does Elon Musk say about singularity?

The singularity also means that tech progress is so rapid that it would exceed the ability of humans to control, predict and understand it. Musk believes that there is still time to act so as not to cross this boundary, which is supposed to impact the future of human civilization. Mar 4, 2023

# Decision Theory

#### How can game theory improve strategic decision-making?

- Game theory is the study of how people or groups make decisions in situations where their actions affect each other (interaction).
- Overall, game theory provides a powerful framework for understanding and analyzing strategic decision-making in a wide range of situations. By modelling the behavior of individuals and groups, it can help us better understand the dynamics of complex systems and make more informed decisions.
- It can help managers understand the incentives, strategies, and outcomes of different scenarios, and design policies that promote cooperation, efficiency, and fairness. E.g.
- The Prisoners' Dilemma 1
- The Byzantine Generals' Problem 2.

### The Prisoners' Dilemma

- Two members of a criminal gang A and B are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in **solitary confinement** with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge.
- Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a **Faustian bargain**. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.
- The goal of both parties will be to **maximize gain and minimize loss (MiniMax algorithm), under uncertainty (stats/mats)**.

### The Prisoners' Dilemma

This leads to four different possible outcomes for prisoners A and B:

1. If A and B both remain silent, they will each serve one year in prison.

2. If A testifies against B but B remains silent, A will be set free while B serves three years in prison.

3. If A remains silent but B testifies against A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free.

4. If A and B testify against each other, they will each serve two years.

![](2__page_39_Figure_6.jpeg)
## The Byzantine Generals Problem

A game theory problem: How do decentralized parties arrive at consensus without a trusted central party?

![](3__page_40_Figure_2.jpeg)

#### The Byzantine Generals' Problem

- The Byzantine Generals Problem is a game theory problem, which describes the difficulty decentralized parties have in arriving at **consensus** without relying on a "trusted" central party.
- If all generals attack at the same time, they will win, but if they attack at different times, they will lose. The generals have no secure communication channels with one another because any messages they send or receive may have been intercepted or deceptively sent by Byzantium's defenders.
- Centralized systems do not solve the Byzantine Generals problem, which requires that **truth be established trustlessly**. Rather, they sacrifice trustlessness for efficiency and choose not to face the problem at all. However, centralized systems are vulnerable to corruption by the central authority.
- Bitcoin was the first realized solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem with respect to money. Its **Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) algorithm** is based on the concept of a **consensus mechanism** (PoW).

How do firms use game theory in decision making?

- Game theory has a wide application in economics. An example is two firms in a **duopolistic market** competing for profits. In this case, each firm attempts to counter the strategies of their competitor to maximize profits. For example, firms may use game theory to determine the optimal price to set for their products, taking into account the possible reactions of their competitors.
- Game theory can also be used to study the behavior of consumers in markets, such as auctions or bargaining situations.
- Game theory can be used to analyze negotiation and bargaining situations, such as salary negotiations, business deals, or diplomatic discussions.
- By understanding the underlying strategic dynamics, individuals/companies can make better-informed decisions and improve their chances of reaching a favourable outcome.
