## TIPS FOR THE FINAL EXAM

- Two pitfalls to avoid: reciting the course without taking into account the questions asked and the elements of the case vs. paraphrasing the elements of the case without providing theoretical content.
- ->  A good essay establishes a **dialogue** between the elements of the case and the theoretical elements seen in class.
- Read the cases very carefully. And read each question at least twice before answering it.
- Beware of digression!
- Be <u>concise</u> and <u>precise</u> in your answers.
- Structure your answers. (S1 §p1)


### TIPS FOR THE FINAL EXAM

- When you use a term, concept or theory from the course, give the definition and explain your point.
- If you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one so as not to waste too much time.
- Take time to read over your answers at the end of the exam. Pay attention to **syntax and spelling**. (S1 §p2)
