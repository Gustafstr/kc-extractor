### What most improves a candidate's chances during the job interview?


# JOB INTERVIEW: SOME RULES AS A RECRUITER

- I inform the candidate of the interview process and how to take notes.
- I ask questions that allow me to identify the skills required for the position.
- I respect the <u>80/20 rule</u>, i.e. I listen 80% of the time.
- I keep an open mind and avoid making my decision in the first few minutes.
- I don't try to influence the candidate.  -
- I inform the candidate of the outcome of the interview and thank him/her
- I complete my evaluation grid on the spot, the same grid for all candidates.  ~ (S12 §p1)


## JOB INTERVIEW: SOME RULES AS A CANDIDATE (BEFOREHAND)

- Find out about the company (website, LinkedIn page, Google News)  -
- Learn about the people to meet (profile/LinkedIn addition)  -
- Review the job description and requirements  -
- Check travel time or Internet connection.  R
- Arrive or log in on time / 3-5 minutes early (send an email or call the recruiter if there are any problems).
- Be appropriately dressed, including in video conference.  ~
- Let the recruiter take the lead in the interview. (S13 §p1)


## JOB INTERVIEW: SOME RULES AS A CANDIDATE (DURING THE INTERVIEW)

- Have a copy of the job description and at least two copies of your CV just in case.

- Be open, attentive and caring.
- Make eye contact and sometimes slow down/leave gaps for questions.

# IV. The persistent challenges of recruitment


# CANDIDATE OR RECRUITER: KNOWING THE BIASES

**Cognitive bias: definition** (S16 §p1)

## **Conformity or social desirability bias** ~

The candidate may be tempted to modify his or her answers according to the  - recruiter's assumed expectations. (S17 §p1)

## **Primacy effect** ~

 The information received first would determine one's impression of others more than the information received later (S17 §p2)

### **Halo effect**

• Since the recruiter is unable to independently evaluate each trait of the candidate, he or she forms an overall opinion based on the evaluation of a single criteria (Laberon, 2011). (S18 §p1)

## THE ISSUE OF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

## THE ISSUE OF DISABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE


# V. The issues of dismissal


## THE ISSUES OF DISMISSAL


## THE ISSUES OF DISMISSAL

- Dismissal is a termination of the employment contract at the initiative of the employer, unlike resignation (at the initiative of the employee) and conventional termination (which requires the agreement of both parties).
- In France, an employee cannot be dismissed randomly or arbitrarily. Any dismissal must be motivated by a **real** and **serious reason**.
- The reason for the dismissal must be both **real**, i.e. the facts must be exact and verifiable, but also **serious**: the facts must be serious enough for the dismissal to be unavoidable
- 2 main types of dismissals: dismissal for personal reasons and economic dismissal. (S20 §p1)


# VI. Elements of conclusion


## RECRUITMENT EFFECTIVENESS: KEY INDICATORS

The failure of a recruitment can cost the company up to 100 000 € (case of the executives) (S21 §p1)


- Example of indicators allowing:
  - to verify the quality of the procedure developed by the recruiter  -
  - to make adjustments if necessary  - (S22 §p1)


## RECRUITMENT EFFECTIVENESS: KEY INDICATORS

- The **duration of recruitment** (time between the request from a department and the  - arrival of the successful candidate)
- **Satisfaction of managers and candidates** with the quality of the recruitment  - process
- The **ratio of candidates** interviewed by recruitment source (measures the quality of  - the source)
- The **ratio of people recruited** by the cost generated by the source of applications  - (measures the effectiveness of the source)
- Percentage of successful **trial periods**  -
- Percentage of **resignations** within the first year (S22 §p2)
