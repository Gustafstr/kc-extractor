# THE EFFICIENCY WAGE THEORY

- When hiring an employee, there is an asymmetry of information. The  ~ employer doesn't know whether the employee will be highly productive or unproductive (a "talent" or not).
- The only way to attract and retain the most productive is to provide a salary above the market price. This also leads the less productive internally to increase their contributions (for fear of being laid off and not finding an equivalent salary). (S8 §p3)
