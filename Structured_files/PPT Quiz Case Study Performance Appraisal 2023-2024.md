# CASE STUDY (IN PAIRS/15 MINUTES OF THOUGHT)

- The HR department of the European headquarters of a multinational company conducted an **anonymous survey** among its employees to find out their opinion on the performance evaluation process conducted according to the classic scheme: an **annual interview** with the manager who fills out a dedicated evaluation form.
- This form includes an assessment of the level of achievement of the previous year's objectives, the setting of new objectives and a development plan for the following year. Salary increases are decided on the basis of this evaluation.
- Gathering employees' opinions proved particularly difficult because most of them spend most of their time in regional subsidiaries and are only physically present in their offices occasionally, even though this is the best time to meet their manager. (S4 §p1)

- A total of **70 of the 154 surveys** sent out were collected. The survey  - results revealed that:
- 65% of employees are not satisfied with performance review as a method of evaluating their work.  -
- 50% of employees believe that their managers cannot objectively evaluate their work because they don't have the information to do so.
- 45% of employees view the annual interview as a formal announcement of a decision already  - made in advance.
- 12% say their managers don't conduct interviews at all, but ask them to sign a pre-filled form.
- 68% of employees believe that performance appraisal results are not used for anything other than salary increases.
- 75% of managers complained about the lack of time to prepare and conduct appraisal interviews.
- 25% of managers admitted to having difficulties in cases where it is necessary to criticize people  - who are evaluated and who regularly overestimate their evaluation scores. (S4 §p2)


#### Questions $\mathbf{L}$

- 1. Analyze the results of the survey (participation rate, acceptability of the current evaluation, fit with the strategy...). What conclusions can you draw about the current performance review system?
- 2. What measures could you suggest the HR department implement to improve the performance review system? (S5 §p1)


### Questions

- 1. Analyze the results of the survey (participation rate, acceptability current evaluation, fit with the strategy...). of the What conclusions can you draw about the current performance review system?
- The current performance review system is based on a **traditional method**: an annual interview
- This seems to be conducted solely for administrative purposes: strategic and development objectives seem to be completely neglected.
- The survey results should be interpreted with **caution**. Indeed, the collection of employees' opinions proved to be particularly difficult. The participation rate in the survey is therefore very low: less than half of the questionnaires sent out were collected (S6 §p1)


### Questions

- 1. Analyze the results of the survey (participation rate, acceptability current evaluation, fit with the the strategy...). of What conclusions can you draw about the current performance review system?
- The **acceptability** of this method of evaluation is **very low**: 65% of employees aren't satisfied with performance review as a method of assessing their work.
- This evaluation method is based on **incomplete information** (**low validity**): 50% of employees believe that their managers cannot objectively evaluate their work, since they don't have the necessary information to do so.
- Many employees question the relevance of this evaluation method: 45% of employees consider the annual interview as the official announcement of a decision already taken in advance. (S6 §p2)


### Questions

- 1. Analyze the results of the survey (participation rate, acceptability current evaluation, fit with the strategy...). of the What conclusions can you draw about the current performance review system?
- The current performance review system appears to be **totally unsuited** to this company. It is the subject of much criticism from both employees and managers.
- It therefore seems appropriate to **rethink the performance review** in this company. (S7 §p1)


- Questions
- 2. What measures could you suggest the HR department implement to improve the performance review system?
- First, HR managers need to think about how their performance review should **align**  - with the company's strategy and, therefore, develop a review system that links employees' behavior and activities to the company's goals.
- HR managers can introduce other forms of evaluation, such as 360° feedback, to  - improve the validity of the evaluation. Peers, customers and/or subordinates may have relevant information to provide a review. HR managers therefore need to think about which actors in the performance review system are able to reduce gaps and provide accurate feedback. (S7 §p2)


- Questions
- 2. What measures could you suggest the HR department implement to improve the performance review system?
- If HR managers want to maintain an annual interview, they can set up **training** for  - managers on how to conduct performance reviews (content, behavior, bias reduction...). (S8 §p1)
