**Case study 1** (S0 §p14)

### *« I don't want to change my selection criteria »*

**(10 points)** (S0 §p15)

A French company specialized in the marketing of cosmetics is facing difficulties in the recruitment of its store managers. The recruiter complains not to receive enough feminine applications and requests the services of a recruitment agency. (S0 §p16)

The first question asked by the consultant of the recruitment agency is: *" If you do not find enough women to apply for this job, why do not you abandon the issue of gender? Men or women, what importance after all?"* This question raised numerous objections on behalf of the recruiter: *" Basically, our human resources are essentially feminine, it is better that a woman manages them; put yourselves into our customers' shoes if they see appearing a man… Moreover, our regional managers are men, and they have with women store managers very privileged relationships! Finally, I'm sure that the male candidates would not be interested in this kind of job position."* (S0 §p17)

### **Questions**

#### **You are the consultant of this recruitment agency.**

**1. What is your reaction about these arguments? What consequences may this type of request have on the company? (4 points- LG 6.1 & 12.1)** (S0 §p18)

**2. How could you help the recruiter to find the best applicants for this job? Make concrete proposals. (6 points- LG 06.2)** (S0 §p19)

## **Case study 2**

# *"Tasty Catering serves up employee-friendly culture"*

## **(10 points)**

If any industry presents difficult conditions for being a high-performing organization, food service is surely one of them. Pay is low, turnover is high and profit margins are slim, so there's not a lot of room in the budget for fancy perks to keep people happy. (S0 §p20)


To get that point, Tasty's owners-Tom, Kevin and Larry Walter- determined that they needed to build a culture employees could care about. The brothers had started the company as the Tasty Dawg chain of hot-dog restaurants, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The food was so popular that requests for catering flowed in, and the Walters created Tasty Catering, eventually closing the Tasty Dawg outlets. Their management style originally focused on controlling but some of the best people were unhappy. To prevent such employees from leaving, the brothers created teams of employees to identify core values. The teams settled on a set of seven, emphasizing ethics, high quality and personal responsibility. Having agreed on the values themselves, employees were committed to making them work. One employee observed that her main hurdle to being productive was frequent interruptions, so her working conditions were adjusted to minimize interruptions and her productivity soared. Similarly, individuals are empowered to improve service quality. If trucks drivers for example, hear that an order contains an error, they can choose to waive payment. (S0 §p21)

Tasty Catering's leaders also opted to share knowledge about the company's finances with employees. The company follows a process of teaching all employees how to understand basic measures of business performance and then sharing the performance data with them in frequent updates throughout each month. Employees understand how their personal and group actions contribute to the success of the business, and they receive bonuses from profits earned above a targeted level. Along with knowledge and rewards, they receive encouragement to share ideas that will help the company increase profits. In the fist quarter of using this approach, Tasty saw its profits more than double. (S0 §p22)

#### **Questions**

**1. Give a short definition of a high-performance management system applied to that business case. Explain how the main elements of this system creates performance in the Tasty Catering company. (5 points - LG 6.3 & 6.4)** (S0 §p23)

**2. What specific HRM practices (for example, in recruitment & selection, performance appraisal or training & development, etc.) could strengthen this high-performance management system? Make three concrete proposals. (5 points- LG 12.1)** (S0 §p24)
