Assistant Professor th.simon@montpellier-bs.com (S0 §p1)

### CASE STUDY (IN PAIRS/20 MINUTES OF THOUGHT)

- Objective: to identify the current issues of gender equality in the workplace and to propose courses of action for companies.
- Question 1: what are your **own stereotypes** about gender in professional life, i.e. with regard to women and men? Identify those that you have as a "woman" with respect to women and men/those that you have as a "man" with respect to women and men.
- Question 2: how do you explain the **persistent inequalities** between women and men in professional life?
- Question 3: beyond the respect of the laws in force, propose **two concrete**  - actions to be taken in the company to try to remedy the inequalities of treatment between women and men. Support your proposals with concrete elements. (S0 §p2)


#### TO START: SOME FIGURES

- 4% of drivers, construction workers and mechanics are women.
- 18% of engineers and computer scientists are women.
- Women outnumber men in food service, cleaning, health care, clerical and  ~ cashier jobs.
- 4% of CEOs of publicly traded companies are women, and women make up only 22% of supervisory board members. (S1 §p1)


#### THE VARIOUS STEREOTYPES

Hetero-stereotype: stereotype about a group to which one does not belong. (S1 §p2)

Ex: I think that computer scientists are useless. Homosexual employees are more tolerant. (S2 §p1)

**Self-stereotype:** stereotype about a group to which one belongs. (S2 §p2)

 $Ex$ : the sales force is the most important position in our company. In my team, those who have the same degree as me are the most successful. (S2 §p3)

**Meta-stereotype:** an assumed stereotype that someone would have about themselves. (S2 §p4)

 $Ex$ : women don't have a chance in this company, I don't apply. I've been in such and such a position: I'm sure X will promote me for that, it happens all the time. (S2 §p5)


#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: THE CASE OF THE GLASS CEILING

- Definition
- It concerns all countries and, in France, both the private and public sectors.
- **Only 15%** of company managers with 20 or more employees are women.  ~
- Women are more affected by unemployment, especially recurrent and long-term unemployment, including when they are graduates of a Grande Fcole. (S2 §p6)


#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: THE CASE OF THE GLASS CEILING

- How can we explain the glass ceiling?  R
- The persistence of gender stereotypes but also of "self-censorship" on the part of women
- A preference for similarity (homophily):  - "masculine" organizations (norms, codes)
- More limited women's networks  -
- The "family-work" conflict  -
- A different vision of career and power  -
- Sexist attitudes in the workplace (lack of an  - inclusive climate) (S3 §p1)


#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: SUMMARY

- On the offer side  ~
- Existence of a **glass ceiling**.  -
- Employers have insufficient demand for women in leadership positions due to  - ordinary sexism and gender stereotypes. (S4 §p1)

 ->  The Cinderella Complex (S4 §p2)

→ The Smurfette principle (S4 §p3)


### THE SMURFETTE PRINCIPLE


#### PERSISTENT INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN: SUMMARY

- On the demand side
- Women are less likely to offer their services for leadership positions because:
  - a lack of identification and self-censorship (**queen bee syndrome**)
  - a lesser proactivity (the Cinderella complex)
  - the desire for a balance of life times (the Cinderella complex)
    - → The Curie myth
    - → "Gender fatigue" (S5 §p1)


# CONCRETE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES

- Importance of "role models" to fight against the Cinderella complex
- ->  Highlighting women with inspiring and exemplary backgrounds (S5 §p2)


The example of **Ines Leonarduzzi** (S5 §p3)

CEO of *Digital For The Planet* (S6 §p1)

Her objective: to raise awareness of digital pollution, to accompany economic actors towards more virtuous uses, to raise citizens' awareness (S6 §p2)


# CONCRETE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES

- Importance of "role models" to fight against the Cinderella complex
- ->  Highlighting women with inspiring and exemplary backgrounds (S6 §p3)


The example of **Sarah Lamaison** (S7 §p1)

CEO of *Dioxycle* (S7 §p2)

X/Cambridge/Collège de France graduate (S7 §p3)

Her objective: to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into chemical raw materials (chemicals, fuels) that are currently produced from fossil resources. (S7 §p4)


# CONCRETE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES

- Setting up **mentoring** and **coaching**
- Creation of an **internal network of women** (e.g. Dell)
- Collaborate with associations to organize awareness-raising events and set up mentoring  ~ (e.g. WonderMeufs in Montpellier, Women and Mathematics...)
- **Mixed gender meetings** to get to know each other and "break" certain stereotypes
- Neutral recruitment process, based on skills. Gender-neutral job descriptions and job offers
- **Training of managers** against discrimination and for the benefits of gender diversity in the company
- **Transparency and fairness in remuneration**: truly applying the principle of "equal pay for equal work"
- Strengthen policies to **balance private and professional life** (S7 §p5)


### CONCLUSION

#### **Key points**

- Real professional equality between women and men is everyone's concern.
- Despite the legal arsenal put in place in France, many inequalities persist.
