### Human Resource and Diversity Management

# Recruiting without discrimination and valuing diversity

Case study (S0 §p1)


Assistant Professor th.simon@montpellier-bs.com (S0 §p2)

- A company has conducted a review of its workforce and skills management. Within the HR department, the company is not able to ensure the succession for the positions of HR managers on the production sites spread throughout France.
- Its population is aging and the managers in place are not mobile. For them, HRM positions on a site don't represent a development either in terms of level of responsibility or in terms of compensation.
- The solution adopted by the company would be to recruit young candidates with initial experience from outside the company and to train them by placing them in assistant positions or with partial responsibilities (such as training, recruitment, skills management or social relations). In this way, the company would create a pool of talent (S0 §p3)


- The HR director addresses his request to the recruitment department as follows:
- > "I want a candidate who is 30/32 years old, whom we would train in our methods and who can grow."
- Questions
- What is your reaction? 1.
- 2. What would you say to the HR director as a member of the recruitment department? Suggest ways of thinking about how to avoid discrimination and value diversity. (S1 §p1)

- Age is an illegal criterion.  -
- Interest of diversity in the company (beware of homophily).
- It is a cliché that older people perform less well in companies.  -
- The high turnover among young people does not guarantee that the candidate  - will stay after having been trained by the company in a perspective of evolution.
- Is it not possible to hire candidates who have been trained by other companies? (S2 §p1)

- 2. What would you say to the HR director as a member of the recruitment department? Suggest ways of thinking about how to avoid discrimination and value diversity.
- Isn't it risky to position very young candidates in positions where experience  - is an asset, especially in a human resources manager position that requires skills in social negotiation?
- Is it possible to consider trajectories other than upward mobility? For example, after 50 years of age, a candidate could return to a position with a lower level of responsibility and desired compensation. (S2 §p2)

- Is it not possible to entrust, in addition to operational responsibilities,  - transversal projects to a senior employee in order to better exploit his or her skills (for example, training and mentoring of young recruits)?
- The company is faced with fewer candidates and very high salary expectations for these profiles aged between 30 and 35 years old, as all the major groups are targeting this type of profile. Wouldn't it be better to change its target? (S3 §p1)
