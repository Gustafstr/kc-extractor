Assistant Professor th.simon@montpellier-bs.com (S0 §p1)

#### PROPOSAL OF FEEDBACK TO PAUL

1. Welcome: "Hello Paul, how are you? I wanted to talk to you today to give you some feedback on your work and your attitude within the team. I have two main points to address." (S0 §p2)

2. Positive feedback: *"First of all, I would like to emphasize that the conduct of your* last projects was satisfactory and that you were able to achieve positive results with your team in a good cohesion. You were able to instill a dynamic of progress and collaboration, and I thank you for that." (S0 §p3)

3. Recall the facts, negative feedback and openness to dialogue: "By the way, I also wanted to talk to you about our last client meeting. We were running late and I caught you having fun before this important deadline. I'm discussing this with you today because this behavior follows on from other moments such as the last two team meetings in which you did not participate. So I would like to understand by exchanging with you... How do you explain it?" (S0 §p4)

 ->  You try to understand whether Paul's behavior is explained by a decrease in his involvement and/or motivation at work or any other reason. Depending on the case, you will adapt your action... (S0 §p5)


### PROPOSAL OF FEEDBACK TO PAUL (NEXT PART)

4. Action: It will depend on the nature of your exchange with Paul, for example... (S1 §p1)

- If he seems bored with his assignments, decide together that he will take on more responsibility in the future and formalize it.
- If he doesn't understand the "meaning" of his work, redefine together SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound) objectives and value "his" usefulness in this position.
- If he doesn't feel "fairly" treated, ask him for his suggestions for improving the decision-making process or interaction patterns at work.
- If he doesn't feel sufficiently "recognized", propose a motivating reward system for future projects... (S1 §p2)


## Now you are ready for constructive feedback!
