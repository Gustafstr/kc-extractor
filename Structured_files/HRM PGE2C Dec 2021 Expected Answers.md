**Case study 1** (S0 §p14)

#### *« I don't want to change my selection criteria »*

**(10 points)** (S0 §p15)

A French company specialized in the marketing of cosmetics is facing difficulties in the recruitment of its store managers. The recruiter complains not to receive enough feminine applications and requests the services of a recruitment agency. (S0 §p16)

The first question asked by the consultant of the recruitment agency is: *" If you do not find enough women to apply for this job, why do not you abandon the issue of gender? Men or women, what importance after all?"* This question raised numerous objections on behalf of the recruiter: *" Basically, our human resources are essentially feminine, it is better that a woman manages them; put yourselves into our customers' shoes if they see appearing a man… Moreover, our regional managers are men, and they have with women store managers very privileged relationships! Finally, I'm sure that the male candidates would not be interested in this kind of job position."* (S0 §p17)

#### **Questions**

#### **You are the consultant of this recruitment agency.**

**1) What is your reaction about these arguments? What consequences may this type of request have on the company? (4 points)** (S0 §p18)

The recruiter expresses **gender stereotypes** (ex: men are not interested in this kind of position) and reveals a noninclusive culture. His cognitive biases may lead to gender-based Discrimination in recruitment which is **illegal** in France as in many other countries. **(2 POINTS)** (S0 §p19)

Consequences from an economic performance perspective ("**business case for diversity"**): (S0 §p20)

Risk of discrimination and significant associated **costs** (direct and indirect loss of reputation). (S0 §p21)

 Risk of deprivation of **talents** that can impede competitiveness **(1 POINT)** (S0 §p22)

Consequences from a CSR and moral perspective **(1 POINT)**: (S0 §p23)

• This kind of behavior is against **equal opportunities** between men and women (moral obligation: social justice). (S0 §p24)

#### **2) How could you help the recruiter to find the best applicants for this job? Make concrete proposals. (6 points)**

#### **Fight against his stereotypes (2 POINTS)**:

o You should not inevitably be a woman to sell products to women, or, on the contrary be a man to sell products to men. the recruiter should **focus on the applicants skills.** (S0 §p25)

O The argument of the low interest for this type of job coming from male candidates is totally unfounded. It is during the job recruitment that the recruiter will judge of the applicants' motivation (men or women) (S0 §p26)

**Remind to the recruiter the potential value of HR diversity for the company. (2 POINTS)** (S0 §p27)

**Widen the criteria of recruitment** to attract a diversity of profiles (Give an example of success of a recruitment where the criteria were opened.) **(1 POINT)** (S0 §p28)

**Plan with the recruiter a support to facilitate the integration** of future newcomers. **(1 POINT)** (S0 §p29)

**Case study 2** (S0 §p30)

#### *"Tasty Catering serves up employee-friendly culture"*

#### **(10 points)**

If any industry presents difficult conditions for being a high-performing organization, food service is surely one of them. Pay is low, turnover is high and profit margins are slim, so there's not a lot of room in the budget for fancy perks to keep people happy. (S0 §p31)


To get that point, Tasty's owners-Tom, Kevin and Larry Walter- determined that they needed to build a culture employees could care about. The brothers had started the company as the Tasty Dawg chain of hot-dog restaurants, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The food was so popular that requests for catering flowed in, and the Walters created Tasty Catering, eventually closing the Tasty Dawg outlets. Their management style originally focused on controlling but some of the best people were unhappy. To prevent such employees from leaving, the brothers created teams of employees to identify core values. The teams settled on a set of seven, emphasizing ethics, high quality and personal responsibility. Having agreed on the values themselves, employees were committed to making them work. One employee observed that her main hurdle to being productive was frequent interruptions, so her working conditions were adjusted to minimize interruptions and her productivity soared. Similarly, individuals are empowered to improve service quality. If trucks drivers for example, hear that an order contains an error, they can choose to waive payment. (S0 §p32)

Tasty Catering's leaders also opted to share knowledge about the company's finances with employees. The company follows a process of teaching all employees how to understand basic measures of business performance and then sharing the performance data with them in frequent updates throughout each month. Employees understand how their personal and group actions contribute to the success of the business, and they receive bonuses from profits earned above a targeted level. Along with knowledge and rewards, they receive encouragement to share ideas that will help the company increase profits. In the fist quarter of using this approach, Tasty saw its profits more than double. (S0 §p33)

#### **Questions:**

- **1. Give a short definition of a high-performance management system applied to that business case. Explain how the main elements of this system creates performance in the Tasty Catering company. (5 points - LG 6.3 & 6.4)**
- A high-performance management system is the combination of people, technology, system of management and organizational structure that makes full use of the organization's resources and opportunities in achieving its goals and implementing the business strategy. It meets customer needs, employee satisfaction, innovation, reduces turnover and stimulates organizational citizenship behaviors.
- In this case, the elements are :
  - o **task design and working conditions**=>Employees are free to organize themselves in their tasks and are directly involved into the organizational or operational decision-making process. They are given a lot of autonomy and **recognition at work** particularly for their skills and achievements; the sense of belonging is also developed (example of the team project to define corporate values). Thus, **self-determination** is largely encouraged (according to Deci & Ryan) which increases motivation at work and commitment to the organization (low turnover).
  - o **reward system**=> extrinsic employee motivation is also encouraged through bonuses and the distribution of these financial rewards are fair. This practice permits to increase **the feeling of distributive and procedural justice** which leads to **higher employee commitment.**
  - o **style of management** => characterized by benevolence, transparency, trust, cooperation =>employee well-being/self-confidence/**empowerment** => higher quality of service. (S0 §p34)

#### **2. What specific HRM practices (for example, in recruitment & selection, performance appraisal, training & development, etc.) could strengthen this high-performance management system? (5 points- LG 12.1) Make three concrete proposals.**

Few proposals: (S0 §p35)

- **-** Employees should be directly included in decisions about recruitment and compensation, for example.
- Peer feedbacks should be encouraged.
- Jobs should be designed to foster teamwork and employee empowerment. (S0 §p36)

- Recruitment & selection tools should focus on identifying specific soft skills necessary for teamwork, empowerment, knowledge sharing, etc. (S0 §p37)
